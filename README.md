# PoC cypress framework interview

Hi! I'm my name is Jose David Morera and this is a small example of what I can do with cypress. 


# Prerequisits
To run this framework locally on your computer you will need to have the following install. 

 - NodeJS
	 - if you don't have this already install you can find the installer [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) 
 - Cypress
	 - This is the engine used to execute the tests, here are the instructions and how to [install](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress). 

# How to execute
Now that you have everything you need just follow the next steps.

 1. Clone the repository from github. In case you don't know how, use this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
 2.  Open the console terminal and go the folder where the repository was cloned
 3. Run the following command "npm run cy:open"
 4. Select the browser you want to use. 
 5. Select the group of tests you want to execute.

# To Edit

To change or add test for the following repository, I recommend the use of visual code to easy code changes and support from git to upload the changes properly. 

# Disclaimer

The page "https://www.latlong.net/" uses geolocation to show different versions of the same page, as well that the login services are not working correctly. Some of my test may fail if executed in a country with a different version of my own.

For the API testing the recommended site isn't working, so I pivot to use open API weather system "https://open-meteo.com/". I created a couple of tests in order to deliver the requested on the pdf file.
